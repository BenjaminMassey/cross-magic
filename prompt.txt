I need a crossword clue for the word {{word}}: a short but clear description of {{word}}.  The clue should not be tricky: it should just describe {{word}} in a clear way. Do not ever use the word {{word}} itself or any close variant of {{word}} under any circumstances, as the clue or part of the clue. Check the definition of {{word}} carefully: wrong definitions are the worst. Make sure {{word}} can be used in a sentence in the way your clue defines it: the clue should have the same plurality as {{word}}, the same tense as {{word}}, the same aspect as {{word}}. Substituting the clue for {{word}} should be grammatically correct. Please respond only with the clue text itself: do not explain the clue or provide any commentary. Do not include a letter count or other annotation. /no_think
